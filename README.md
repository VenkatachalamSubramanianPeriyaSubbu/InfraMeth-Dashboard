# InfraMeth Dashboard - Chicago

## Project Overview
This project visualizes methane emissions alongside critical infrastructure in the Chicago metropolitan area using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools.  
The interactive map provides insights into the spatial relationship between methane emissions and schools, pipelines, power plants, and industrial facilities.

The goal is to support environmental monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, and urban planning.
